My current semester project.<br/>
For that reason, many many things are not in their final state and some features don't work yet.

In Deeper, you descent into the ocean with your submarine with a collection of missions. These missions will require you to return to the research station with a picture of a specific fish.<br/>
Upon mission completion, you will receive Funds and Research Points.<br/>
With Funds you will be able to upgrade the submarine to allow e.g. for venturing deeper into the ocean with one of the depth upgrades.
Research Points unlock information about the fish, of which you captured the pictures.

What currently works:
- most UI elements (except Mission Completion Screen, Journal, and Upgrades Tab)
- Submarine Movement
- Taking/Saving Pictures
- Boid schooling behaviour + Obstacle Avoidance + Target Point Seeking
