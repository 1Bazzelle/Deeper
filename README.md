My third-semester project.<br/>

In Deeper, you descend into the ocean with your submarine with a collection of missions. These missions will require you to return to the research station with a picture of a specific fish.<br/>
Upon mission completion, you will receive Funds and Research Points.<br/>
With Funds you would be able to upgrade the submarine to allow e.g. for venturing deeper into the ocean with one of the depth upgrades, although for the reason of me being the only programmer and the team deciding that other features would have priority over the submarine upgrades, this did not make it into the game.
Research Points unlock information about the fish, of which you captured the pictures, which you can find in the Journal.

Key Features are:
- Boid Algorithms + Obstacle Avoidance + Target Point Seeking + Dynamic Selection of Leader Boids to guide their school
- Taking/ Saving/ Evaluating Player-Taken Pictures
- Use of UI Toolkit
