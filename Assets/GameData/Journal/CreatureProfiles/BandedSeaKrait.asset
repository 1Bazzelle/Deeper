  infoLevel1: Banded sea kraits are semi-aquatic. They spend a lot of time under
    water to hunt but have to return to the surface to breathe, digest their meals,
    shed skin, and reproduce.
  infoLevel2: Sea kraits can produce very potent neurotoxic venom that they use to
    hunt small fish and eels.
  infoLevel3: Sea kraits are curious creatures that often encounter humans due to
    their proximity to land. They usually aren't aggressive if they don't feel threatened.
