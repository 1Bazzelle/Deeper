  infoLevel1: "EXPERT HUNTERS\nBlacktip Reef Sharks have sharp senses! They can smell
    a drop of blood in a million liters of water, see in the dark and hear struggling
    fish up to a mile away. This makes them dangerous predators\u2014 but don\u2019t
    worry, they\u2019re rather shy and usually avoid humans!"
  infoLevel2: 'SPECIAL BONDS

    Known for being territorial as well as social,
    groups of Blacktip Reef Sharks often stay in the same area for years. They hunt
    together, defend their territory together and generally display a great communication
    and organization within their flock!'
  infoLevel3: "SIXTH SENSE\nBlacktip Reef Sharks have electroreceptors \u2014 a sixth
    sense that detects electrical signals from muscle movements. This way they can
    find  prey hidden in the\_ sand or under rocks only by sensing its tiny heartbeat!"
