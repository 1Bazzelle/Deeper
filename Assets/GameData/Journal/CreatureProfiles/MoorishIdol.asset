  infoLevel1: "ICONIC LOOKS\nWith its dramatic shape and striking black, white, and
    yellow stripes, the Moorish idol looks like it swam out of a painting! Despite
    its beauty, it\u2019s a tough fish to keep in captivity due to its picky diet
    and specific needs."
  infoLevel2: 'ANCIENT SYMBOLISM

    Revered by many Polynesian cultures, the Moorish
    idol is often seen as a symbol of good luck and spiritual protection. Its unique
    appearance makes it a frequent subject in island art and tradition!'
  infoLevel3: 'ONLY SURVIVOR

    The Moorish Idol is the only extant species of
    its family - the Zanclidae. Other species of the family are long extinct, only
    found in prehistoric fossils, making the Moorish Idol a unique biological phenomenon!'
