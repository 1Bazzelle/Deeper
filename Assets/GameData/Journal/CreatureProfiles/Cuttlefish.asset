  infoLevel1: 'CHAMELEONS OF THE SEA

    The Broadclub Cuttlefish is a master of
    disguise! Using specialized skin cells they can change color, pattern, and  texture
    in seconds. With 13 unique body patterns, they blend into their surroundings,
    scare off predators, hunt stealthily, attract mates - and even communicate with
    other cuttlefish.'
  infoLevel2: "MATING SEASON\nFor cuttlefish, mating season is a once-in-a-lifetime
    event \u2014 literally. With a short lifespan, they reproduce only once before
    dying. During this crucial time, male Broadclub Cuttlefish put on a dazzling
    color show to impress females. They flash bright patterns and stretch their bodies
    to twice their size \u2014 trying to outshine any competitors!"
  infoLevel3: "ENTRANCING PERFORMANCE\nThe Broadclub cuttlefish uses its color changing
    abilities in many creative ways. When hunting it performs a rhythmic pulse of
    color waves to hypnotize its prey. Imitating ocean waves allows it to get close
    enough \u2014\_and strike the clueless prey with its tentacles!"
