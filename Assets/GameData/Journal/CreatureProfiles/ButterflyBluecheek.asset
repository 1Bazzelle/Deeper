  infoLevel1: 'SOULMATES

    Butterfly fish are true romantics! They form strong
    monogamous pairs that stay together for life. During mating, they engage in synchronized
    swimming displays, often fluttering side by side before releasing their eggs
    and sperm into the water in a graceful, shared dance.'
  infoLevel2: 'PICKY EATERS

    Pairs share a territory that they defend and use
    for feeding. With  their narrow snouts they nibble on tiny invertebrates, like
    polyps, hiding within coral. Agile and precise, they dart between reefs for a
    feast, playing a crucial role in coral health!'
