  infoLevel1: "SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP\nClownfish and sea anemones share a mutually
    beneficial relationship! The clownfish find protection among the anemone\u2019s
    stinging tentacles, while they clean the anemone and scare off predators, creating
    a safe haven for both!"
  infoLevel2: 'ONE BIG FAMILY

    It''s true! Most Clownfish live in groups that
    consist of two parents and their offspring. They follow a strong hierarchal order
    with the biggest female leading the group and the strongest male as her mating
    partner. This male protects the eggs and cares for the babies until they are
    old enough to join the group!'
  infoLevel3: "HERMAPHRODITES\nClownfish are all born male - but they have a unique
    ability. Within one week they can change their sex to become a female! After
    the female of a\_group dies the biggest male will take on the role of the new
    leader and change its gender accordingly!"
