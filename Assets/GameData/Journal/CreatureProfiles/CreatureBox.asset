  infoLevel1: 'ICONIC COLORS

    Known for their vivid coloration, boxfish actually
    change their colors as they grow! Juveniles start out bright yellow with bold
    spots to mimic toxic patterns that ward off predators, but as they age, their
    colors fade to blues, browns, or greys for better camouflage.'
  infoLevel2: "NATURAL ARMOR\nThe boxfish wears natural armor made of bony plates,
    forming a tough, hexagonal shield that protects it from predators. Despite its
    rigid shell and boxy shape it glides through water dynamically \u2014 even inspiring
    designs for cars and robots!"
  infoLevel3: "TOXIC\nThe boxfish may look cute, but it\u2019s packing a secret weapon
    \u2014 toxin-loaded slime! When stressed, it releases a deadly poison that can
    wipe out predators and even nearby fish. A\_reason for their solitary lifestyle..."
