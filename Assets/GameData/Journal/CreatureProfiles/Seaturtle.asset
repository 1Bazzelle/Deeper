  infoLevel1: 'REEFS PROTECTORS

    Hawksbill sea turtles play a vital role in reef
    health by munching on sponges, which allows corals to grow and thrive. Without
    them, reefs could be overrun by sponges, disrupting the ecosystem!'
  infoLevel2: "DEADLY BEAUTY\nThe hawksbill\u2019s stunning, patterned shell \u2014
    known as \"tortoiseshell\" \u2014 has made it a target for illegal trade for
    centuries. Their beauty, sadly, has put them on the critically endangered list."
  infoLevel3: 'SENSE OF HOME

    Hawksbill turtles travel thousands of miles across
    the ocean but always return to the same beach where they were born to lay their
    eggs. This incredible navigation skill is still a mystery to scientists!'
