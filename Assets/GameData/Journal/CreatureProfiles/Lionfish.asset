  infoLevel1: 'HUNTING BEHAVIOUR

    Red Lionfish have a BIG appetite. They eat
    up to 20 fish per feeding session -

    using their fan-like pectoral fins.
    They corner their prey, then  strike with lightning speed, swallowing the fish
    whole.'
  infoLevel2: 'INVASIVE SPECIES

    Originally native to the Indo- Pacific region
    the Red Lionfish is now terrorizing the Atlantic Coasts, devouring local species
    en masse which is destroying the natural balance and endangers many coral reef
    ecosystems. They make up 92% of all invasive fish out there!'
  infoLevel3: "VERY RESILIENT\nEquipped with  venomous spines and having close to
    none natural predators, the Red Lionfish thrives in every environment. It also
    reproduces rapidly - with females laying up to 30.000 eggs every month! Its resilience
    makes it\_ one of the most common coral reef habitants."
