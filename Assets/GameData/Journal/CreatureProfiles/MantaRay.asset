  infoLevel1: "SMALLER COUSINS \nThe Reef Manta Ray is actually the smaller of the
    two Manta Ray species. Its bigger cousin - the Giant Manta Ray - can get up to
    7m long and weigh 2000 kg. These giants travel across the open oceans and dive
    hundreds of meters deep in search for food."
  infoLevel2: 'ENDANGERMENT

    Humans are the biggest threat to manta rays, with
    over 5000 killed yearly due to overfishing and bycatch. Climate change and pollution
    are shrinking their habitats, leaving Reef Mantas vulnerable and Giant Mantas
    endangered according to the IUCN.'
  infoLevel3: 'MIRROR TEST

    Having the biggest brain of all fish species and
    also the highest brain-to-body ratio, Manta Rays are the only fish able to recognize
    themselves in a mirror.

    They only share this ability with a handful of other
    animals, making Manta Rays one of the smartest animals in the kingdom!'
