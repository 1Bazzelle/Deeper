  infoLevel1: 'OVERFISHING

    Just like their blacktipped cousins, Whitetip Reef
    Sharks are heavily targeted for their fins and liver oil. And with low reproduction
    rates and shrinking reef habitats, they can''t recover fast enough. If overfishing
    continues, their population will continue to drop 6-8% each year!'
  infoLevel2: "BUCCAL PUMPING\nUnlike other reef sharks, Whitetip Reef Sharks can
    breathe while staying still! They use a method called buccal pumpingto draw water
    through their gills, letting them rest motionless on the ocean floor \u2014 perfect
    for taking a quick nap!"
  infoLevel3: 'UNDERWATER ASSASSINS

    Whitetip Reef Shark are quite clumsy hunters
    in open waters! Instead of using speed and endurance like many other sharks,
    the Whitetip Reef Shark is specialized in stealth and agility. Using their slender
    bodies they wiggle into small reef crevices to ambush hiding prey.'
