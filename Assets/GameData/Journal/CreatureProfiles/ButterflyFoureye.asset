  infoLevel1: 'PLAYDATES

    Butterflyfish pairs always stay close to each other,
    and love engaging in playful activities like chasing each other or performing
    colorful dances! When getting separated they swim up and search for the other
    other until they are united again!'
  infoLevel2: 'PICKY EATERS

    Pairs share a territory that they defend and use
    for feeding. With  their narrow snouts they nibble on tiny invertebrates, like
    polyps, hiding within coral. Agile and precise, they dart between reefs for a
    feast, playing a crucial role in coral health!'
