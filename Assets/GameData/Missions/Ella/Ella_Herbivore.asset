  title: Capture Herbivore Species
  description: 'Heya, I need some more material for the website, can you give me
    a picture for the section on herbivores? Oh and I just looked this up: Iff they
    eat Phytoplankton they stil count as herbivores, not if they eat Zooplankton
    though. And it says here, sponges also count as other animals, so they can''t
    eat them either.


    Try and make it look cool! Thanks a bunch!'
