  title: Capture Manta Ray
  description: "Heya!\nI wanted to spruce our website up a bit! Always easier to
    get funds and donations when the design doesn\u2019t just consist of boxes and
    rainbow coloured comic sans text (don\u2019t tell Larrington I said that by the
    way, he\u2019s really proud of his work apparently o.0).\nBut yeah, I thought
    a Manta Ray might be really nice! Thank u!!"
