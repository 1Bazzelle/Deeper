  title: Capture Endangered Species
  description: "Good morning, Dearie!\r\n\r\nI just saw a report about ocean creatures
    near extinction due to human hunting\u2014terrible, isn't it? As an expert, you
    must understand how urgent this is! So, I had a marvelous idea: I'll knit sweaters
    featuring these creatures to spread awareness in my neighbourhood.\r\nCould you
    send me a photograph of an endangered creature to use as a design?\r\n\r\nLots
    of Love,\r\nMargaret"
